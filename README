     Whenever you start Vim (but no more than daily) the script will open a
help window with a Vim tip. You must download the tips separately, from
http://vim.sourceforge.net/tips/tip_download.php

    After installation, you can get the next tip with

:TipOfTheDay

(usual abbreviation rules apply) or go to the top of the tips file with

:help vimtips.txt
